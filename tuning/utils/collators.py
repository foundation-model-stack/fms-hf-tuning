class VisionDataCollator:
    """
    A data collator specialized for multi-modal (text + image) inputs.
    It uses a processor (e.g., LlavaProcessor or MllamaProcessor) to
    combine text and images into model-ready tensors.

    For padding-free tuning, configure the processor's arguments
    in `processor_kwargs`, for example:
        processor_kwargs = {
            "padding": False,
            "max_length": 1024,
            ...
        }

    Args:
        processor: A processor (like `LlavaProcessor`, `MllamaProcessor`, etc.).
    """

    def __init__(self, processor):
        self.processor = processor

        Collate function that:
            1. Extracts text and image data from each example in `features`.
            2. Uses `self.processor` to tokenize/encode them into a single batch.
            3. Creates `labels` by cloning `input_ids` and masking out:
                - Padding tokens (if `pad_token_id` is defined) with `-100`.
                - Special image tokens with `-100`.

        Args:
            features (List[Dict[str, Any]]):
                A list of examples (dicts). Each dict must have:
                - "processor_kwargs": Additional arguments passed to the processor.
                - "fields_name": A dict with "dataset_text_field" and "dataset_image_field"
                that identify the text and image keys inside each example.

        Returns:
            batch (Dict[str, torch.Tensor]):
                A dict where each key corresponds to a batched tensor created from the
                respective feature key in `features`. A new key `"labels"` is added,
                which is a clone of `"input_ids"` with padding and image tokens masked as `-100`.
