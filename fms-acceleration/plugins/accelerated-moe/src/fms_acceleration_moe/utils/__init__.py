# this is a special patch function to disable foreach for
# dtensors, which has been introduced since torch 2.4.
# The reason is because this will cause problems in the optimizer
# RuntimeError: aten._foreach_mul_.Scalar: got mixed torch.Tensor and DTensor,
# need to convert all torch.Tensor to DTensor before calling distributed operators!

    # this is an array of supported types, we will remove
    # dtensor from it, so the optimizer will faillback to per
    # parameter
