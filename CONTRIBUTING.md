# Contributing

👍🎉 First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing. These are just guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## What Should I Know Before I Get Started?

### Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant](./code-of-conduct.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

Please report unacceptable behavior to one of the [Code Owners](./CODEOWNERS).

### How Do I Start Contributing?

The below workflow is designed to help you begin your first contribution journey. It will guide you through creating and picking up issues, working through them, having your work reviewed, and then merging.

Help on open source projects is always welcome and there is always something that can be improved. For example, documentation (like the text you are reading now) can always use improvement, code can always be clarified, variables or functions can always be renamed or commented on, and there is always a need for more test coverage. If you see something that you think should be fixed, take ownership! Here is how you get started:

## How Can I Contribute?

NOTE: Before making any contribution, please ensure the content does not include any IBM proprietary information or any specific information about IBM products. 

For any contributions that need design changes/API changes, reach out to maintainers to check if an Architectural Design Record would be beneficial. Reason for ADR: teams agree on the design, to avoid back and forth after writing code. An ADR gives context on the code being written. If requested for an ADR, make a contribution [using the template](./architecture_records/template.md).

When contributing, it's useful to start by looking at [issues](https://github.com/foundation-model-stack/fms-hf-tuning/issues). After picking up an issue, writing code, or updating a document, make a pull request and your work will be reviewed and merged. If you're adding a new feature or find a bug, it's best to [write an issue](https://github.com/foundation-model-stack/fms-hf-tuning/issues/new) first to discuss it with maintainers. 

To contribute to this repo, you'll use the Fork and Pull model common in many open source repositories. For details on this process, check out [The GitHub Workflow
Guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/github-workflow.md)
from Kubernetes.

When your contribution is ready, you can create a pull request. Pull requests are often referred to as "PR". In general, we follow the standard [GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) process. Follow the template to provide details about your pull request to the maintainers. It's best to break your contribution into smaller PRs with incremental changes, and include a good description of the changes. 
We require new unit tests to be contributed with any new functionality added. 

Before sending pull requests, make sure your changes pass formatting, linting and unit tests. These checks will run with the pull request builds. Alternatively, you can run the checks manually on your local machine [as specified below](#development).

#### Dependencies
If additional new Python module dependencies are required, think about where to put them:

- If they're required for fms-hf-tuning, then append them to the [dependencies](https://github.com/foundation-model-stack/fms-hf-tuning/blob/main/pyproject.toml#L28) in the pyproject.toml.
- If they're optional dependencies for additional functionality, then put them in the pyproject.toml file like were done for [flash-attn](https://github.com/foundation-model-stack/fms-hf-tuning/blob/main/pyproject.toml#L44) or [aim](https://github.com/foundation-model-stack/fms-hf-tuning/blob/main/pyproject.toml#L45).
- If it's an additional dependency for development, then add it to the [dev](https://github.com/foundation-model-stack/fms-hf-tuning/blob/main/pyproject.toml#L43) dependencies.

if using `poetry` to install dependencies, you can optionally leverage [poetry add](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#add) to add new dependencies to pyproject.  

#### Code Review

Once you've [created a pull request](#how-can-i-contribute), maintainers will review your code and may make suggestions to fix before merging. It will be easier for your pull request to receive reviews if you consider the criteria the reviewers follow while working. Remember to:

- Run tests locally and ensure they pass
- Follow the project coding conventions
- Write detailed commit messages
- Break large changes into a logical series of smaller patches, which are easy to understand individually and combine to solve a broader issue

Maintainers will perform "squash and merge" actions on PRs in this repo, so it doesn't matter how many commits your PR has, as they will end up being a single commit after merging.

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report ✏️, reproduce the behavior 💻, and find related reports 🔎.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues using the Bug Report template](https://github.com/foundation-model-stack/fms-hf-tuning/issues/new?template=bug_report.md). Create an issue on that and provide the information suggested in the bug report issue template. 

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features, tools, and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion ✏️ and find related suggestions 🔎

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues using the Feature Request template](https://github.com/foundation-model-stack/fms-hf-tuning/issues/new?template=feature_request.md). Create an issue and provide the information suggested in the feature requests or user story issue template.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Improvement Item?

Improvements to existing functionality are tracked as [GitHub issues using the User Story template](https://github.com/foundation-model-stack/fms-hf-tuning/issues/new?template=user_story.md). Create an issue and provide the information suggested in the feature requests or user story issue template.

## Development

### Set up your dev environment

The following tools are required:

- [git](https://git-scm.com)
- [python](https://www.python.org) (v3.8+)
- [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (v23.0+)
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) (v1.8.3+)
  - Poetry should always be installed in a dedicated virtual environment to isolate it from the rest of your system. It should in no case be installed in the environment of the project that is to be managed by Poetry. This ensures that Poetry’s own dependencies will not be accidentally upgraded or uninstalled.
- [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/4.15.1/installation.html) (v4.15.1+)
  - Just like `poetry` install `tox` in an isolated virtual environment

Installation:

```bash 
: Install poetry and tox in an isolated virtual environment
python3 -m venv isolated
./isolated/bin/pip install -U pip setuptools
./isolated/bin/pip install poetry tox

: Ensure you can access poetry and tox without activating the
: the isolated virtual environment
export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/isolated/bin

: Create your development virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate

: Install a dev version (similar to pip -e ".[dev]") of fms-hf-tuning
poetry install --extras dev
```


> Note: After installing, if you wish to use [FlashAttention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention), then you need to install these requirements:
 
```
poetry install --extras dev,flash-attn
```

If you wish to use [aim](https://github.com/aimhubio/aim), then you need to install it:
```
poetry install --extras aim
```

If you wish to use [fms-acceleration](https://github.com/foundation-model-stack/fms-acceleration) follow the instructions in [this section of README.md](README.md#fms-acceleration).

<details>
<summary>Linting</summary>

To lint your code:
```
    make lint
```

We use Pylint to checks your Python code for errors, coding standards, code convention and refactoring suggestions.

Pylint emits [messages](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/messages/index.html) that provides explanations of the failed checks.

You should fix all message in the following order:
1. Fix each message provided. Select a message [description](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/messages/messages_overview.html#messages-overview) to fix a message.
2. Disable a message (i.e: unbalanced-tuple-unpacking) caused by a particular line of code:
    ```python
    a, b = ... # pylint: disable=unbalanced-tuple-unpacking
    ```
    Please see [here](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/messages/message_control.html#block-disables) for the progma syntax.

3. Disable a checker globally. Please extend the `disable=` list in the [pylintrc](.pylintrc) file.
    > Note: Disable checkers only if there is good reason.

<summary>Formatting</summary>

To format your code:
```
    make fmt
```
We use [black](https://github.com/psf/black) formatter to format the code.

You could optionally install the git pre-commit hooks if you would like to format the code automatically for each commit:
```
brew install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Unit tests</summary>

To run unit tests:
```
    make test
```
Running unit tests ensures your contributions do not break exiting code.
We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) framework to run unit tests. The framework is setup to run all run all test_*.py or *_test.py in the [tests](./tests) directory.

> Optionally, run `make all` command to do formatting, linting, and testing at once.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Build wheel</summary>

To build a wheel file:
```shell
tox -e build
```
Running the command will create a single ZIP-format archive containing the library source code with the .whl extension in the `dist/` directory.

## Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these issues:

- Issues with the [`good first issue` label](https://github.com/foundation-model-stack/fms-hf-tuning/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - these should only require a few lines of code and are good targets if you're just starting contributing.
- Issues with the [`help wanted` label](https://github.com/foundation-model-stack/fms-hf-tuning/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - these range from simple to more complex, but are generally things we want but can't get to in a short time frame.
