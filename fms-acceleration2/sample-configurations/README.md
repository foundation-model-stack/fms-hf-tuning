# Sample FMS Acceleration Configurations

This directory contains sample `AccelerationFramework` configurations, meant to demonstrate how the various [plugins](../README.md#plugins) are to be used with `sft_trainer.py`.

## Acceleration Configurations

These are stored in YAML files in this directory. Also provided is 
a [contents list](./CONTENTS.yaml) with an entry for each file, documenting:
- `shortname`: short name used to succintly identify each file.
- `plugins`: list of relevant plugins that [must be installed](../README.md#usage-with-fms-hf-tuning) to properly use the framework configuration file.
- `filename`: actual filename of config in this directory.

See main README on [how these sample configs should be used](../README.md#usage-with-fms-hf-tuning).
